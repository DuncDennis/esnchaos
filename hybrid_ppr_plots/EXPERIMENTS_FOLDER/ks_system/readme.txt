In order to also test the different hybrid methods for a spatio-temporal chaotic system,
they are applied to predict the KuramotoSivashinsky System, using the same KS-params
as in Pathak 2018 (original hybrid).
The lyapunov exponent is calculated as: 0.07489 (compared to 0.07 in Pathak 2018).

The following experiments are done:

1) r_dim sweep, while fixing the model error at eps=1.0

2) eps sweep, while fixing the r_dim at 4000
